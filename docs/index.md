# Learn Web3 Development using React, NextJS, and Tailwind

Everyone is talking about web3, even if Elon can't find it. Massive amounts of money are pouring into DeFi, making crypto adoption surge to all time highs. Developers who have the skills needed for Blockchain development are in high demand, which means, they are being paid well for what they know.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React that you are used to are here to stay, and they are indeed play a part in web3 development. In fact, that Mongodb database is fine just where it is as well. Web3 is built on _top_ of that.

## What you will learn in this course

- Writing functional based JavaScript
- Building and extracting behavior into React components
- Adapting React web2 idioms to web3
- How to read Solidity and libraries like OpenZeppelin
- How to write unit tests for Solidity using JavaScript
- Build a basic understanding of cryptocurrency and tokens
- Build a basic understanding of DeFi

## What you will be building, live with your instructor

Using a couple of simple Solidity contracts, we will have a set of two tokens that can be traded. This is known as a token swap, and it utilizes an automatic market-maker and a liquidity pool and our dapp to allow people to exchange one token for another. You could say it is the basis for all DeFi.

We will go through the full stack, JavaScript to Ethers to the Blockchain via Solidity. We will build React components that can monitor events on the Blockchain, and update the UI. These components will be resusable for your own web3 projects.

## What is the learning experience like?

Each live session will be a mix of me coding and explaining everything in detail, and us having conversations about coding and debugging along the way. After the session you would jump into the provate Discord to discuss the session with your cohorts, and you can self-assemble and recreate what you learned on your own.

I will also be posting JavaScript challenges and tips in the Discord for you to do extra credit work.

## Expect excellence from your instruction

There are an endless supply of poorly made tutorials and videos by people with very little experience, as well as content that is just out of date or doesn't follow best practices. It is a very confusing landscape.

In my program you can have confidence that you are learning from an expert. I have been writing JavaScript since 1997 and I was very early in the React revolution. I have worked at immense and immensly small companies, old companies and startups. I have a great track record of both mentoring developers, and completing projects on time and on budget.

But more importantly, I have been writing JavaScript and other languages long enough that I can naturally write clean, testable code, almost as easy as I can speak. I have gone through the journey needed to know what tool to use and when to use it.
